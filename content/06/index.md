# 6. Debugging and testing

In this section we will presentthe set of tools provided by Android Studio for debugging and testing an app.

Debugging should not only be done in case of error, but systematically to check that our code is running correctly.

We will discuss different types of tests: **local tests** and **instrumented tests**. Local tests correspond to those known as *unit tests* of separate components and instrumented tests correspond to functional and integration tests. *Functional testing* attempts to determine that the application meets the required functionalities. Meanwhile *integration testing* checks that components operate correctly when they need to call each other to perform more complex tasks.

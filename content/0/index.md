# Mobile app development

## About the course

This website contains the course materials for a course on "Mobile app development". Starting from scratch, this course teaches the fundamentals required to create native Android mobile apps using the Kotlin programming language.

The course requires some previous knowledge. Programming skills are a must (specially an object-oriented programming language like Java), as well as basic knowledge about relational databases (SQL), web development (HTML) and networking.  Basic notions in software design patterns are also a plus.

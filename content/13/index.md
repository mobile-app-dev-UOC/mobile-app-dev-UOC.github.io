# 13. Notifications

There are two types of notifications in Android

- **Remote notifications:** They allow remote services to send us messages to provide information. These are typical messages from a personâ€™s inbound messaging applications, messages to indicate the status of a shipment, messages from bank applications when a receipt arrives, ...

- **Local notifications:** These are the notifications generated from the apps installed on the device itself. A very common one is using a timer to alert the user of something. 


In terms of how we receive a notification from our app, there are two different scenarios:

1.	The application is running in the foreground. 
2.	The application is running in the background or the application is not running.

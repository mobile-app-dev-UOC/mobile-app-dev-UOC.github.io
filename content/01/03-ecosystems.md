# 1.3 Ecosystems

Mobile devices incorporate an operating system that encapsulates hardware features and offers libraries for easy development and APIs to access additional services. We refer to an operating system (or a family of related operating systems) as an **ecosystem**, which includes the set of hardware devices that support it, and the set of available libraries and services (app store, maps, mobile payment, ...). 

In addition to choosing the target ecosystem for an application, it is important to determine the target **version** of the ecosystem. Higher versions will offer more features, more services, and access to the latest hardware capabilities of the latest devices. However, they will also be supported on fewer devices so our app will not be available to certain users.

## Apple (iOS, iPadOS, watchOS)

As often happens with Apple, Apple owns its own proprietary operating systems for its mobile devices. This gives them more control of your products and optimizes their operating systemâ€™s use of available hardware.

[iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios) is the operating system used on iPhone devices. The same system was also initially used on other Apple devices such as the iPad and iPod.

iOS was designed from Mac OS. It included aspects related to mobile interaction and changing the permission framework to fit a device where computer-savvy users install and uninstall many apps, each with different permissions. It highlights the level of security achieved on your devices, which includes file system encryption.
	
In 2019, Apple introduced [iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ipados) to replace iOS on its tablet-style devices. iPadOS is essentially iOS with the following added capabilities: 

-	Multitasking. Similarly to desktop operating systems, iPadOS devices can run multiple applications at once. These are distributed across the tablet screen and are all visible at the same time.
-	Added keyboard and mouse support.
-	Support for external storage drives is added.
-	Allow the tablet to act as a second monitor on an Apple computer without the need to install additional software ([Universal Control](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757)).

[watchOS](https://www.apple.com/watchos) is the operating system used in Apple smart watches. It was also created from iOS.  At first, watchOS was only a remote desktop and apps were running on the iPhone. Starting with watchOS 4.0 and Apple Watch Series 3 apps already run independently on the watch.  Apple has focused the Apple Watch on e-health to the point of including the ability to perform electrocardiograms.
